Author's Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Author Note #01 (11/17/09)
--------------------------
Once again I have restarted this guide from nothing due to a problem with my 
PSP. I ordered replacement parts hoping to see lasting results, but never 
received any. After taking a good look at my PSP more recently I can say that 
the problem most likely lies with the clear connector between the joystick and 
the motherboard. Unfortunately I will not be attempting to repair it for the 
time being, as the PSP has become more trouble than it's worth. The specific 
problem with the PSP is that the analog stick has trouble functioning making it 
difficult if not impossible to play at certain points within the game. 
Eventually I will get a new PSP but for the time being this is my situation 
while writing this guide.

Author Note #02 (11/28/09)
--------------------------
Not much has changed in the guide since the last update, due to my barely 
functioning PSP. The joystick has become so problematic that most games have 
become completely unplayable. Luckily I was able to borrow a PSP from a good 
friend, so there is a good chance I will actually get to finish this guide.

Author Note #03 (12/09/09)
--------------------------
Finals for this semester are scheduled for this week and the following week, 
hindering progress on the guide quite a bit. Hopefully when the semester ends I 
will be able to get a considerable amount of work done on the guide.

Author Note #04 (01/17/10)
--------------------------
I was able to get a bit of work done during the break between semesters, but 
Holidays and moving in for the current semester has put the guide at a 
standstill once again. I hope to optimistically have the 1.00 version of the 
guide released by February.

Author Note #05 (05/17/10)
--------------------------
Things during the semester did not go as optimistically as I had planned for in 
terms of this guide, but I have just finished the Walkthrough section today. I 
plan on publishing the guide as soon as I finish proof reading the guide.

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

I have written a few personal FAQS and Walkthroughs for various games that I 
have played in the past. After doing this for a while I decided that I should 
finally write a guide that would eventually be published for public use. The 
reasons for choosing this game to write a guide for are fairly simple. I have 
enjoyed playing a majority of the prior titles in the Harvest Moon franchise, 
and at the time of writing this guide no professional company had written one 
for this game. After searching the internet for a while I failed to find any 
guide that I would consider reading over while playing, due to them being in an 
unreasonable format or incomplete.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synopsis of the Storyline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The story begins on a small island in the southern hemisphere named Heartflame 
Island. The year is 2022, and you soon find that nearly every aspect of life 
that required manual effort has been replaced by some form of automation. The 
farm that you are given has had most of its fertile land sealed off by the 
Spirits of the Island. This was due to a war fought in the past between the 
Easter people and the Volcano People for the control of the island. The war had 
greatly angered the Spirits, and was the reason they decided to seal off the 
fertile land of the Easter Ruins. After the war the Easter People had left 
Heartflame Island never to return. The Spirits had given the inhabitants of the 
island one chance at redemption. If someone could once again return life to the 
Easter Ruins by their own hand, the seals on the land would be broken. This 
became a problem as the Volcano People only cared for farming by automated 
means and had given up on the Easter Ruins completely. Few if any on the island 
still believe in the existence of the Spirits of the island. This caused the 
Spirits to become angry, which could threaten to destroy the entire island. It 
is your job to save the island, as you are the only one who can.

Tips, Tricks, and Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tips and Tricks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#01:
----
With the start and select button having no functionality, it raises the 
question "How do I pause the game?". Long story short there isn't an official 
pause button in the game, but you are able to stop the flow of time when you 
open up your Inventory or the Main Menu.

#02:
----
I will not advise using this trick as the Sickle is the hardest tool to level 
up, but it is still worth mentioning. You are still able to dispose of weeds 
without using PP despite the changes to the game engine. First place the weed 
in your inventory by picking it up and pressing the circle button. Then with 
the weed selected in your inventory press the square button and it will be sent 
to the trash.

#03:
----
You are able to save the game without the use of the diary, a feature that many 
of the other Harvest Moon titles lacked. To do so bring up the Main Menu and 
scroll to the Player Info tab. Then hit the triangle button, which will bring 
up the save screen. 

#04:
----
Time does not pass while giving a response or using a menu, so don't rush a 
decision to a question or action.

#05:
----
This is probably the most useful trick I have found while playing the game. It 
allows you to recover your PP effortlessly. You can get around another 100 PP 
in a single day using this trick. All you need to do is allow your character to 
stand idle. When he has started swaying back and forth with his hands behind 
his back (almost as if he were dancing), you are now beginning to recover some 
of your PP. The formula as to how much PP will be restored is as follows.

[Note: Using this in conjunction with getting up early allows you to be 
extremely efficient with your time for a day.]

Formula:

[x] = (Initial 30 Minutes of standstill time.)
Note: [x always equals 1]

[y] = (Each additional 15 minutes of time that you stand still) 
Note: [y is equal to how many 15 minute intervals that you stand still for]

PP restored = ([x] * [6 PP]) + ([y] * [6 PP])


Examples:

30 Minutes of Standing Still:  ([1]*[6 PP]) + ([0]*[6 PP]) = 6 PP
45 Minutes of Standing Still:  ([1]*[6 PP]) + ([1]*[6 PP]) = 12 PP
60 Minutes of Standing Still:  ([1]*[6 PP]) + ([2]*[6 PP]) = 18 PP
120 Minutes of Standing Still: ([1]*[6 PP]) + ([6]*[6 PP]) = 42 PP

#06:
----
Do not use the PSP speakers to listen to the game. Many reviews ranked the 
sound both poor and repetitive. While I may not be able to argue against 
repetitive, I can tell you that if a decent set of stereo headphones are 
plugged into the PSP the game will sound like it should.

#07:
----
Immediately discontinue use of Power Soles and Snow Soles as they are useless. 
You should use the D-pad for precise walking, and the analog stick for running.

#08:
----
If you have not tried it already, hold down triangle in the same fashion that 
you would try to use a leveled up tool to plant seeds in a 3x3 plot instead of 
one at a time. This will save you a lot of time in later seasons when 
attempting to plant the whole field.

If you do not have enough PP to destroy a rock or weed and direly need to do 
so, you can throw it into the water by the lifts. This is not recommended 
unless you have fully leveled up your Hammer.

#10:
----
After you have completed the first week you can use the Shine Pod in Dr. Hope's 
mansion. This will fully recover your PP.

#11:
----
You can use the Hot Spring located across the bridge with the raft to recover 
your PP. You will recover 10 PP for every 5 minutes in the Hot Spring.

#12:
----
Having breakfast with Dr. Hope will give you an increase in Love and Cooking. 
So if you feel you're lacking in these two stats, you should start sleeping 
over at Dr. Hope's mansion so that you can have breakfast with him in the 
morning.

Walkthrough
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

This walkthrough will give a day by day guide to finishing the main storyline 
during the first year of game play. It will also leave you fully prepared to 
complete the optional challenge that becomes available upon completing of the 
game. During the walkthrough I will only account for what needs to be finished 
during that day, leaving the rest of the day to do as you please. You can do as 
much or as little as you desire after completing the tasks for the given day. 
During the course of making the guide I simply went to sleep after completing 
what was required, but you can spend the rest of the day doing whatever you 
want.

Ring 0, Winter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------
Winter, Day 33 (Fri.):
----------------------
This first thing you need to do when you gain control of your character is 
speak with Dr. Hope. When you have finished speaking with Dr. Hope you will 
need to speak with Gayak. Then once again speak with Dr. Hope, answering yes to 
his question. Afterwards you will need to complete Gayak's farming tutorial, 
which is relatively straightforward. 

----------------------
Winter, Day 34 (Sat.):
----------------------
Upon waking up head downstairs. Once you have finished eating Marlene's meal, 
respond with yes. Afterwards speak with Marlene and you will receive your 
second Seed Bag. Then go into the basement to speak with Gayak, he will give 
you 9 Turnip Seeds. Next walk back up stairs, and when Marcia asks you a 
question respond with yes. When dinner is over Dr. Hope will ask you a question 
respond with yes.

----------------------
Winter, Day 35 (Sun.):
----------------------
Walk out of the Shine Pod and go outside the mansion through the front door. 
You will find Dr. Hope in front of a grave on the other side of a bridge to the 
left of the mansion.

Ring 1, Spring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------
Spring, Day 01 (Mon.):
----------------------
Use the lift in your room to go up to your farm. When Franco has finished 
speaking with you plant and water your 9 Turnip seeds. When this is complete 
speak with Franco and answer yes. You now need to speak with everyone who has 
come to visit the Easter Ruins. When you have done this speak with Franco once 
again and everyone will take their leave. At this point you are able to save 
your game, and I recommend doing so. You should also backup the save data via 
USB so you don't have to sit through the introduction should you choose to 
restart your game from the beginning. Afterwards head over to the Item Box and 
put away the Power Soles and Snow Soles, as they only take up space in your 
inventory. Next head down to the river on the left side of the Easter Ruins and 
collect the Strange Moss. It will take you three trips to collect all of it. 
Once you have finished collecting the Strange Moss you can speak with Franco to 
learn why you are going to be working the fields at the Easter Ruins. Moonlight 
will not be awake at this point so don't bother visiting him.  After speaking 
with him the only things left to do are watch TV and being to level up your 
tools. You will need to start leveling up your tools as much as possible, 
particularly your Watering Can. This will allow you to use the level 2 Watering 
Can which is essential to maximizing profits and making your farm work much 
easier. Make use of Trick 05 so that you can get additional work done each day. 
Attempt to finish up before 21:00 so that you can get up earlier than usual, 
but if you choose to work late into the night be sure to go to sleep before 
02:00 otherwise you will awaken at 08:00 instead of the normal 06:00.

Hoe: 114 SP Until Next Level
Watering Can: 406 SP Until Next Level

----------------------
Spring, Day 02 (Tue.):
----------------------
If you did not wake up early you will be able to watch the Drama Channel, so 
that you have seen everything that will air during weekdays. Afterwards go up 
to your farm and water the Turnips. You should continue to level your tools and 
today you will be able to get a significant amount more watering done due to 
spaces staying tilled. After running out of PP you can use Trick 05 from the 
afternoon bell up until the evening bell. This will restore nearly the entire 
PP bar. Make an effort to be finished before 21:00 so you can wake up early, as 
it makes getting things finished a bit easier.

Hoe: 69 SP Until Next Level
Watering Can: 279 SP Until Next Level

----------------------
Spring, Day 03 (Wed.):
----------------------
More people will be on your farm today, both of which will leave after speaking 
with you. Afterwards go down to visit Franco. Answer yes to the question he 
asks and you will receive a free Iron Sickle. Speak with him again to find that 
Million was kind enough to leave you with some Asparagus Seeds. Head up to the 
Storage Area and get the seeds out of the Seed Box. Then go up to your farm and 
plant them. Water both of your crops and continue to focus on leveling up your 
Watering Can. Once you have exhausted all of your PP use Trick 05. Tomorrow you 
should be able to hit level 2 in both your Hoe and Watering Can. I will 
recommend waking up early once again.

Hoe: 37 SP Until Next Level
Watering Can: 118 SP Until Next Level

----------------------
Spring, Day 04 (Thu.):
----------------------
Franco will be up on the farm when you wake up. Speak to him if you wish. Then 
water your crops. Afterwards begin to level up your tools, using Trick 05 when 
you have run out of PP. Once you have achieved level 2 in your Watering Can 
focus on leveling the Hoe up to level 2. After you have level 2 in both the 
Watering Can and the Hoe use the Sickle to begin clearing your farm of weeds. 
When you have run out of PP for the second time begin to gather all of the 
rocks into a central location near the Shipping Pods. This will make the 
leveling of your Hammer go much smoother. Don't bother waking up early tomorrow 
it will be raining.

----------------------
Spring, Day 05 (Fri.):
----------------------
Your daily routine of watering your crops is freed up by the rain. Use today to 
continue leveling your Sickle and gather all the rocks into a convenient place 
to break and ship them. You should be able to clear the entire field by around 
12:00. Afterwards go down to your room and start cooking some dishes. Refer to 
the Cooking section to see what is available at this point in the game.

----------------------
Spring, Day 06 (Sat.):
----------------------
You will find Franco waiting in anticipation for the upcoming harvest when you 
go up to your farm. Max will be jogging around between the altars. After you 
water your crops take a quick lap around the farm to see if any new weeds have 
grown or if any rocks have appeared. Afterwards watch the Anime Channel on the 
TV so that you can see all the programming for the current week. Continue to 
utilize Trick 05 so that you get the most out of the days that you are stuck at 
the Easter Ruins. Don't worry about waking up early; it won't change the time 
that you awaken.

----------------------
Spring, Day 07 (Sun.):
----------------------
Today you will harvest your Turnips, Moonlight and Franco will be waiting for 
you in your room. Speak with Franco and answer yes to his question. Then water 
your Asparagus and take a lap to clean up your field. Use up your remaining PP 
on leveling the Watering Can. You can then ship all of the Turnips. Now speak 
with Franco and answer yes. Then speak with Dr. Hope and answer yes.

----------------------
Spring, Day 08 (Mon.):
----------------------
When the tour of town is over go up to your farm and plant the Asparagus Seeds 
that were given to you by Marcia. Put off watering them for the time being 
until you get your Level 2 Watering Can. After planting the Asparagus Seeds you 
can put away all of your items so that you can collect the Strange Moss by East 
Lake in two trips instead of three. When you have finished collecting the 
Strange Moss make your way into town. First thing you will want to do is go to 
the Shop-a-Million and purchase the Iron Axe. Then feel free speak with 
whomever you like until 16:00. At 16:00 go into Masami's Restaurant / Bar and 
speak with Masami. If this is your first time speaking with her you will need 
to exit and walk back into the bar. Then speak with her again to receive the 
Level 2 Watering Can. When you get back to your farm put away the Doctor's WC 
and take out Masami's WC. You should also take out the Iron Axe as well. Now 
water your Asparagus and clean up your field. Ship all bundles of wood that 
appear when chop a fallen tree limb while cleaning your field. Use all 
remaining PP on your Watering Can.

----------------------
Spring, Day 09 (Tue.):
----------------------
When you wake up watch the Cooking Channel and make all the dishes available at 
this point. Then go up to your farm and ship your Asparagus and water your 
crops if it isn't raining. Clear your farm of anything that may have appeared 
overnight. Head into town if you feel like socializing, but you can also try to 
get in some exploring to familiarize yourself with where the Gathered Items are 
located.

----------------------
Spring, Day 10 (Wed.):
----------------------
After shipping the Asparagus and bundles of Wood you should have around 2600G 
which isn't a bad start. Water your crops and use as much PP as possible before 
heading into town. You will want to purchase the Iron hammer, 49 Strawberry 
Seeds, 20 Cucumber Seeds, 20 Cabbage Seeds, 5 Pansy Seeds, 5 Tulip Bulbs, and 5 
Potato Seeds. Next go to Dr. Hope's mansion and use the Shine Pod to fully 
restore your PP. Now head back to your farm and plant all of the seeds. You can 
now break up all the rocks on your field and ship the Stone that is created. 
When you have finished breaking up all the rocks you can pat down any tilled 
plots that have no seeds planted. Wake up early tomorrow.

----------------------
Spring, Day 11 (Thu.):
----------------------
Water all of your crops and continue to pat down tilled plots until none are 
left. Then take a lap around your field and clean it up. You can now begin to 
level up your Hammer and Hoe by tilling a plot of land and then patting it down 
with the hammer. When you run out of PP begin to use Trick 10 as opposed to 
Trick 05 as it is more efficient. You should be able to use Trick 10 twice 
before going to sleep. Get up early tomorrow to continue leveling your tools.

as it will be early with nothing else to do. When you are finished go and watch 
the Cooking Channel. As usual cook anything that has become available to you. 
Then head into town. Use Trick 10 and visit Dr. Hope if you wish. I purchased 5 
Cabbage Seeds to fill the plots that Potatoes occupied. Next you can go to the 
Shop-a-Million to purchase the Scale Pack, Boomerang, and Water Pistol. 
Afterward go back to your farm and plant the Cabbage Seeds. You can then get 
your Scale Pack out of the Item Box and head to the Mushroom Forest 1 to

pack. Use your remaining PP to level your tools. I chose to wake up early.

crops, clean your field, and use the remaining PP to level your tools. 
Afterwards head to Dr. Hope's for maintenance. When that is finished head into 
Heartflame Cave A and open the Grain Key Door. Smash all of the rocks you see 
while in the cave. If you find any Crimson Stones or Ochre Stones save them in 
your backpack so they turn into Plain Ore. Then go to Heartflame Cave B and 
find the Blue Jewel and two Yellow Jewels in the blue chests. You will want to 
save the Plain Ore in case you fail to complete an event later in the game. 
When you get back to your farm put away the Grain Family Key, the Jewels, and 
all but the smallest stack of Plain Ore. This way you can get some Plain Ore on 
your Other Shipped Items list and still start saving. Use your remaining PP to

----------------------
Spring, Day 32 (Thu.):

collect some more Fly Agaric if you so desire. Once you have shipped the Fly 
Agaric use Trick 10 so that you have enough PP for every rock in the cave 
system. When finished you can hang around in town to socialize, but be sure to 
get back in enough time to ship the Volcano Ore and store the Plain Ore while 
still being able to get up early.

----------------------
Spring, Day 33 (Fri.):
----------------------
Ship your Strawberries and Asparagus. Water your crops, clean up the field, and 
then go to the cave system. Finish out the collection of Plain Ore for the day 
and then you are free for the rest of the day. Just be sure to save enough time 
to put away the Plain Ore and ship the Volcano Ore while still waking up early.

----------------------
Spring, Day 34 (Sat.):
----------------------
Ship all your Strawberries and Asparagus, water the crops, and clean up the 
field. Feel free to socialize in town before collecting the Plain Ore for the 
day. Be sure to put away your Plain Ore and ship your Volcano Ore. Make sure 
you wake up early as tomorrow is the last day of the season.

----------------------
Spring, Day 35 (Sun.):
----------------------
Ship all Strawberries, and feel free to water if you want to. Go down to your 
room to ship your flowers and then head into the cave to collect some Plain 
ore. Upon finishing you should go to Dr. Hope's mansion for your maintenance.
Answer yes to keeping the name. Forte will speak in all caps, essentially 
making him the robot version of Billy Mays. Speak with Forte and you will be 
transported to the Easter Ruins. Put away all Plain Ore and ship the Volcano 
Ore. You can now stop collecting Plain Ore as a part of your daily schedule as 
close to 100 should be sitting in your Item Box. You should be at MAX! in your 
Hoe, Watering Can, and Hammer at this point in time. If you have failed to get 
MAX! in any of these tools you should try to do so as quickly as possible so 
that you can use the higher level tools as soon as you obtain them. Wake up 
early because tomorrow will be a busy day.

End of Week 5.

No new items are available at this point.

Ring 1, Summer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------
Summer, Day 01 (Mon.):
----------------------
Put away all of your tools and items so that collection of Strange Moss is 
easier. Collect the Strange Moss in both locations then take all of your tools 
and items back out of the Item Box. The only options you should turn on for 
Forte are the Collect Resources and Water Crops, because you still need to 
level up your Sickle. You can now head into town to make a large purchase. Buy 
the following: Balloon Tent, Auto Unit, Bas&Ket 20S, 2 Bas&Ket Carts, 100 of 
each Bas&Ket Rail. This will cost a total of 66060G. Also purchase 25 of each 
seed available. The seeds will cost 3750G. Now use Trick 10 and then head back 
to the Easter Ruins. Use the raft to cross the river to where the bridge was 
repaired. Now go into Hearflame Cave C which is located next to the Hot Spring. 
On the top path of the cave you will find three blue chests, lined up in a row, 
which contain a Blue Jewel, Yellow Jewel, and Blue Jewel. Next go down into 
Heartflame Cave D to find a blue chest on the left side of the lake which will 
contain a Yellow Jewel. While in the cave you can smash rocks to find some 
Easter Ore for your shipping list, as well as some extra Plain Ore for storage.
Once you have smashed the rocks in Cave C and Cave D head back to the Easter 
Ruins using the raft. You will now have enough Jewels to unlock a sealed field 
on the farm. I chose the one in the top left corner because it is spacious and 
doesn't contain boulders. Take out all of your Yellow Jewels and place them on 
the four alters at each corner of the field. Then put away all the other jewels 
and Plain Ore. Ship all Volcano Ore and Easter Ore. Do not plant any of the 
seeds today due to the guaranteed storm on the 8th. Before going to sleep begin 
clearing the field of all dead plants, but chances are you won't finish. Be 
sure to head to sleep early enough to wake up early after running out of PP.

Axe: 78 SP Until Next Level
Sickle: 1282 SP Until Next Level

----------------------
Summer, Day 02 (Tue.):
----------------------
Continue to clear your field of dead plants. When you finish clearing the field 
you can pat down all tilled plots of land. Then head into town to use Trick 10. 
Afterwards stop in your room to watch the Cooking Channel and make the dishes 
available. Remember to make the summer only dishes. Then go into Heartflame 
Cave C and head up to Heartflame Cave E. In Cave E you will find a Blue Jewel 
down by the water. When you obtain the jewel you can smash rocks if you haven't 
managed to get 120 Plain Ore by this point. Otherwise head back to your farm 
and get the Blue Jewels out of the Item Box. You can then place them in the 
altars inside of the Yellow Jewel field that you unlocked. After continue to 
clean up the field and pat down any tilled plots. Once again go to sleep with 
enough time to wake up early as it will be another busy day.

Axe: 78 SP Until Next Level
Sickle: 1236 SP Until Next Level

----------------------
Summer, Day 03 (Wed.):
----------------------
Continue to clean your field. Head out of the Ruins Entrance and get on your 
buggy, if the buggy has not appeared walk in and out of the Ruins Entrance. Now 
you can go see the Hermit to unlock some new areas of Heartflame Cave. The 
sandstorm at the end of Cave E has also been cleared as a result of the Blue 
Jewel seal being broken. Head out of that exit and continue across the 
Heartflame Desert. Then continue north across the Path from Heartflame Desert 
to Heartflame Plains and Mermaid Lake. Go into the Hermit's Hut and answer her 
question with yes to clear the Fallen Trees path. Afterwards go west and 
collect some Cacao and Papaya. Now begin to head back, on the way collecting 
some Banana and Rambutan. When crossing the Heartflame Desert collect some 
Pepino. You should only really need to collect one of each of these, as money 
from the Scale Pack is almost meaningless at this point but you will want to 
get them on the Shipping List. Once you have collected all of these head down 
to the Heartflame Dunes and speak with the Fisherman in his hut. He will be the 
only way that you can fish within Innocent Life. Now head over the Heartflame 
Plains and begin fishing, it should only take a few minutes to hit MAX! 
depending on your luck. Basically all you need to do is repetitively hit the 
triangle button, as the time the line sits in the water is not relative to your 
chance of catching a fish. When you hit MAX! go to Volcano Town to speak with 
Jonathan and you will receive the Cluck-o-Matic! which allows you to buy 
chicken on the World Ranch Channel. Go back to your farm and purchase 5 
Chicken. Next go back into town and speak with Jonathan again to receive the 
Baabaa-matic! which allows you to purchase sheep on the World Ranch Channel. 
Once again return to your farm and this time buy 5 Sheep. Now go back to 
Volcano Town and speak with Jonathan again to get the Moo-o-Matic. Again go 
back to your farm and this time purchase 5 Cows. Now ship the contents of your 
Scale Pack and take the Balloon Tent out of the Item Box. You can then head 
over to the Fallen Trees Path via the raft. In Heartflame Cave F you will find 
the Master's Axe, Master's Hoe, and a Red jewel. Proceed into Cave G and you 
will obtain the Volcano Sickle, Blue Jewel, and Red Jewel. Afterward you can go 
into Heartflame Cave G to collect a Red Jewel. Continue into Heartflame Cave I 
to get Earth Power Sand. Now go into Heartflame Cave J and collect another 
Earth Power Sand, a Yellow Jewel, and a Purple Jewel. Now use the Balloon 
Tent's warp function by answers no then answering yes. Wake up early tomorrow.

----------------------
Summer, Day 04 (Thu.):
----------------------
Cook all the dishes unlocked from the fishing you did yesterday. Then put away 
all the Jewels you obtained yesterday, the Iron Axe, Iron Sickle, and Iron Hoe. 
Then clean up your field, but be sure to charge your Sickle by holding triangle 
so that you get 2 SP for a single weed instead of 1 SP. Afterwards go to 
Mushroom Forest 2 and collect one of each of the following mushrooms: Purple 
Shimeji, Wood Ear, Enoki, Shimeji, and White Wood Ear. Now go back to your farm 
and ship them. Next you should head down to the Storage Area and care for your 
animals by talking to each of them once. Then convert all but one of the Eggs 
and one of the Milk so you can get both of them for your Shipping List. 
Livestock will provide substantial income on top of the profit from shipping 
crops. Next visit the Shop-a-Million Vending Machines through the blue door to 
the left of Franco's room and purchase 25 of each seed that you don't already 
have. Hold off on purchasing the motor at this point in the game as there is no 
dire need for it. Remember not to plant any seeds because of the guaranteed 
storm on the 8th day. Now go to the Shop-a-Million to purchase the new items 
for sale which will cost you 8900G. Afterwards speak with Jonathan again to 
find out how to ride wild horses. Now go to the Heartflame Plains and speak 
with the Fisherman. Answer yes to his question and then press triangle towards 
a horse to whistle to them. Press triangle again to dismount from the horse. 
When you have finished riding go back to your farm and prepare the Yellow and 
Blue Jewel fields for planting. This will be easy with the charged Master's 
Hoe. When you have tilled all the plots of land take out the Earth Power Sand 
and use it on the plots that you could not till. When you finish this task you 
can go to sleep.

----------------------
Summer, Day 05 (Fri.):
----------------------
Use today to catch up on things that you might have missed. An example would be 
if you have failed to collect 120 Plain Ore do so today. Another good thing to 
check is to see you have shipped all the gathered items in the past few days. 
When you are positive you didn't miss anything clean up your field. Then go 
down to care for your animals and ship their converted goods. Afterwards go to 
the Shop-a-Million to purchase the new Bas&Ket items available for sale today 
which will cost you 20300G.

----------------------
Summer, Day 06 (Sat.):
----------------------
Clean up your farm, then take care of your animals and ship their converted 
goods. Today will be another day you can use to catch up on anything you are 
behind on. Head over to the Shop-a-Million again today to purchase the items 
that are available for sale today which will cost a total of 33800G. Don't 
bother waking up early if you are all caught up.

----------------------
Summer, Day 07 (Sun.):
----------------------
Clear your farm of anything that may have appeared, then take care of your 
animals and ship their converted goods. When you finish your farm work go into 
town for maintenance with Dr. Hope. Answer no to Marcia's question. The rest of 
the day can be used to catch up. Do not wake up early because tomorrow will be 
a stormy day.

tomorrow so that you have no problem getting all of your seeds planted.

expect another storm to hit during the summer. Clean up your field, and then 
care for your animals and ship their converted goods.

----------------------
Summer, Day 13 (Sat.):
----------------------
When hit with a storm you will lose a majority of your Roses, when this happens 
go down to the Shop-a-Million Vending Machines. I chose to purchase 27 more 
Rose Seeds as well as 27 Pineapple Seeds. Plant both of these within the Blue 
Jewel field. You can pat down the tilled spaces left from the storm, but in my

for your animals and ship their converted goods.

Ship all of your Onions, and then clean up your field. Next you can continue to

clean up your field. Then care for your animals and convert their goods. 
Afterwards make your way to the Hermit's Hut and collect the following: Mock 
Strawberry, Fig, and Peach. You can fill your Scale Pack with Peaches after 
getting one of each of the others. This will help recoup money lost in the 
storm. 

----------------------

Clean up your field and then ship your Tomatoes and Green Peas. Afterwards care

Summer, Day 17 (Wed.):
----------------------
Ship your Tomatoes, Squash, and Corn. Afterwards clean up your field and then 
go care for your animals and ship their converted goods. If you have lost 
nearly all of a certain crop to a storm you should plant another 25 of them 
today, but make sure that you can harvest the crop before the end of the 
season. For example I lost all of my Melon yesterday, and chances are you will 
need to replant Roses, Pineapple, Melon, and possibly Watermelon. After 
replanting I went to collect Cacao and Papaya to recoup income lost in the 
storm.

----------------------
Summer, Day 18 (Thu.):
----------------------
Ship your Tomato and Watermelon, and then clean up your field. Upon finishing

Hammer and an Orange Jewel. The second floor will have a Purple Jewel, Purple

Forest Crest in exchange. Afterwards go and meet the Mermaid at the Southwest 
Bank of Mermaid Lake and she will open up the Mist Forest. Go to the Mist 
Forest and get the Monsoon Watering Can out of the first blue chest. You will 
need this to complete the game in the first wither. It will be late by the time 
you get this item so begin to head back. You should collect the Blueberries and 
Peaches before heading back. Remember to ship your Scale Pack before bed.

----------------------
Summer, Day 23 (Tue.):
----------------------
Another storm hit me today. Put away Masami's WC now that you have the Monsoon 
Watering Can. Same thing goes for the Iron Hammer and Easter Hammer. Next ship 
your Tomatoes and clean the field. You can break up the large stones today with 
the Easter Hammer. Afterwards care for your animals and ship their converted 
goods. When you finish watch the Cooking Channel and cook all dishes available.

----------------------
Summer, Day 24 (Wed.):
----------------------
Ship your Tomatoes and Lemons. Then go to your room to ship the Roses. Now care 
for your animals and ship their converted goods. In order to make some extra 
money which was lost in the storm I decided to plant 90 Squash Seeds in the Red 
Jewel field. You can then collect some mushrooms and speak to the Hermit to 
find a bit more about the main story. When finished ship your Scale Pack.

----------------------

purchase 3 of the Earth Power Sand to use inside the cave. You can then head 
back to the Vending Machines at the Easter Ruins to purchase 50 of both 
Rosemary and Lavender Seeds. Also purchase the Convey-R DXPRO2. Now take out 
the 3 Earth Power Sand, 3 Strange Moss, and the Rosemary Seeds and head to the

----------------------
Clean up your farm, and then care for your animals and ship their converted 
goods. Next watch the Cooking Channel to see the final part and then make 
everything available at this point. If you failed to put down Strange Moss in 
the cave you will need to water the herbs in the Fire Spirit Cave daily. 
Afterwards collect some Blueberries and Mock Strawberries. Ship the Scale Pack.

----------------------
Summer, Day 30 (Tue.):
----------------------
Ship anything you can and then clean your field. You can then care for your

unfertile land.

and ship their converted goods.

----------------------
Summer, Day 33 (Fri.):
----------------------
Clean up your field and ship anything you can. Care for your animals and ship 
their converted goods. If you encounter a storm replant the Rosemary seeds in

Million and purchase 100 Onion Seeds to plant in front of the lift. They will 
be used to help level the Sickle.

----------------------
Summer, Day 34 (Sat.):
----------------------
Ship whatever you can and clean up the field. Next care for your animals and 
ship their converted goods. Continue to care for your herbs. Afterwards 
purchase quite a few Lavender Seeds and Rosemary Seeds because you can't get 
them in the fall. This is a precaution against another storm hitting and 
destroying the herbs. I recommend having 50 of each in storage, which should 
not be a problem because seeds are cheap.

----------------------
Summer, Day 35 (Sun.):
----------------------
Another storm had hit me today. Clean up your field and ship anything you can. 
Next care for your animals and ship their converted goods. Continue to care for 
the herbs. Afterwards go to Dr. Hope's mansion for maintenance. You will learn 
about the Mushroom Forest, but avoid harvesting Porcini if you encounter it 
early. You will need to Porcini for an event next season. If you still don't 
have Level 3 in your Watering Can you will need to achieve it before the end of 
the next season. Otherwise you will need to wait for Winter Ring 2 before you 
can progress the story. Be sure that Remove Garbage hasn't been set on Forte 
because you need to level up your Sickle. Be sure to wake up early tomorrow.

you will want to ship all the herbs you couldn't buy during Ring 1. After you 
have done that you will want to complete the Fire Spirit's challenge which can

Ribbon to whoever you want as the game is already over. To finish the Gathered 
Items list you will need to assist Sharon with the Mushroom Cooking Contest, 
she will ask for your help on the 22nd of autumn. The Black Truffle will be 
located in Mushroom Forest 2. You will have enough to help her on the 23rd 
because she only requested 50g. Then after giving her the 50g go back and
